## Monte Carlo simulation for birthday Assignment ##
#---------------------------------------------------#

#There is a famous problem in statistics that concerns a room full of people: 
#Same Birthday! An instructor offers a prize of $ 20.00 to anyone who thinks that two people in the room have the same birthday.

#Your assignment is to build a Monte Carlo simulation to tell the instructor how many people need to be in the room to give 
#him/her a better than 50 Percent chance of winning the $20. That is to say, how many people need to be in a room in order 
#for the probability of two of them having the same birthday is greater than 50%. Do the same for 95% and 99%.
